# 7. Using xUnit

Date: 2023-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want our code to be robust and error-free.

## Decision

We will use the xUnit.NET framework to write automated tests.

## Consequences

It will take more time to develop a feature, but it will be documented and easier to maintain and
understand in the future.
