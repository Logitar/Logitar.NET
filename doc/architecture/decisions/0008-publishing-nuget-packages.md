# 8. Publishing NuGet packages

Date: 2023-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to share our code with other projects not in this repository.

## Decision

We will publish our class libraries as NuGet packages.

## Consequences

Our code needs to be robust, easy to maintained, and well documented for it to be integrated in
other external projects.
