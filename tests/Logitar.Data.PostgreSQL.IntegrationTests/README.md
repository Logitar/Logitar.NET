# Logitar.Data.PostgreSQL.IntegrationTests

This project provides integration tests for the `Logitar.Data.PostgreSQL` project. In order to run the integration tests, you must have a running PostgreSQL database. The easiest way to do so is by using Docker Compose and running the following command, using the default values. The connection string is already configured in the `appsettings.json` file.

```sh
docker compose up
```
